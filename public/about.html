    <p>My name is Lilian and I am 24 years old. I was born in France and I lived there for 12 years. In 2010, I moved to Canada with my parents where I completed my education and decided to start studying in the multimedia integration technical program. In this program, I learned about photo and video editing, Web-design and video game programming. After graduating from this program in 2018, I started working for a company called Zytix, for which I designed a website. Unfortunatly, the company went out of business one year later and I had to be let go.

    Since my skills were only limited to front-end Web-design,I felt that I didn't have enough to offer and I decided to become a full stack web developper. I found a part time job in a call center, where I was responsable for testing out surveys and getting feedback from the employees making the calls on what should be changed before that survey officially launches as well as handle the translation of the survey from French to English or from English to French if need be, and the rest of the time I spent learning about back-end web developping in a very reputable course I bought online.

    <br />
    In July 2020, I moved to Germany for personal reasons and I started working part-time at HZDR (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf) as a web developper, all the while finishing my online course in full stack web developping and getting my C1-Level Diploma in German, which was the level required to be able to study in Germany. In October 2021, I started what's called a "Dual Study" in Business Information Systems, that means a 3 year bachelor that will contain a mix of theorie and practice semester, which means semesters reserved for learning at the university and others reserved for working full-time in a company. The company I work for in the practice semesters is called PM Automotive GmbH. In this company, I'm involved in all IT and "digitalization" projects of the company with the goal of using current technologie to automatize certain processes in the supply chain production.

    This is where I'm at right now ! I hope to graduate next year and use my full stack web developping skills as well as what I learned in my Dual Study and put it to great use for my employer in the coming years !</p>
